Description: Infrastructure for estimating probabilistic distributional regression models in a Bayesian framework.
  The distribution parameters may capture location, scale, shape, etc. and every parameter may depend
  on complex additive terms (fixed, random, smooth, spatial, etc.) similar to a generalized additive model.
  The conceptual and computational framework is introduced in Umlauf, Klein, Zeileis (2017)
  <http://EconPapers.RePEc.org/RePEc:inn:wpaper:2017-05>.
