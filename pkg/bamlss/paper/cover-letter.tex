\begin{letter}{Prof. Dianne Cook\\ Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics}

\opening{Dear Prof. Cook,}

first of all we thank you, the Associate Editor and the reviewer for the fruitful suggestions
and for considering the manuscript ``BAMLSS: Bayesian Additive Models for
Location, Scale and Shape (and Beyond)'' for publication in the \emph{Journal of Computational and
Graphical Statistics}.

I am pleased to send you our revised version. We have tried carefully to take into account all of
your comments. Based on your feedback we have made the following major improvements:
\begin{itemize}
\item We have outsourced many parts of the method part into an online supplement.
\item Based on the comment of Reviewer 1, a small additional example now illustrates how to
  apply \textbf{bamlss} and how to start using it.
\item Generally, we have shortened various paragraphs in the text. We reduced the
  initial manuscript size by 6 pages up to the summary and by 9 pages including the references. If
  we drop the JCGS review \LaTeX-template line spacing of 1.45 the manuscript is exactly 30 pages
  long now (including the references). We could drop the last example if necessary, however, we
  believe this illustration particularity presents the strengths of this approach and we would
  therefore prefer to keep it in the manuscript.
\end{itemize}

Thank you again for your consideration.

\closing{Yours faithfully,}
